# Canadian Case Law: Visualized

## Overview

## Methodology

My assumption is that the citation graph of Canadian case law is sufficient to
find interesting data in the law. Unfortunately, this data doesn't seem to exist
in any convenient format. [CanLII](TODO) makes the data available on the web,
but doesn't provide any sort of downloadable database. So I needed to make my
own.

I wired up a small web-scraper that would connect to CanLII and crawl through
the hundreds of thousands of cases available there. My program would randomly
pick a case that had been mentioned in the citations another decision, but which
it hadn't yet explored. It would then go to that page, record all the cases it
cited, and then randomly pick a new page.

TODO: graph discovery gif

At first I prioritized the Supreme Court decisions --- assuming these were the
most important cases --- and then loaded the cases from each province's Court of
Appeal. After a few days, I'd discovered 323,596 cases from 217 different
courts, and explored 240,964 of them. In total, there were 1,332,193 citations
in the dataset. Frighteningly, this is nowhere near all of the case law (I'd
estimate it's maybe one tenth of the publicly-available cases), but if I waited
to collect all of it I'd never get any work done.

Despite the large number of cases, it's important to discuss just how little
data I've got *per* case. The totality of my data about cases is of this form:

  </table>
  <figcaption>citation data</figcaption>
</figure>

You'll notice there's really nothing here. Just some case names, what year they
happened, what court they appeared in, and the cases they cite. That's it.
There's no court transcripts, list of presiding judges, content keywords, or
even information about who won. In principle I could have extracted the involved
parties by trying to tear apart the name, but it didn't seem like it would buy
me much.

To reiterate, there's nothing at all that we can use to learn what any
particular case was *about.* In this database, the vast majority of the
information available to us is which cases cite whom.


### Possible Issues

The Canadian legal system has existed much longer than the idea that information
should be freely available. While CanLII is an excellent source of data, it
explicitly states how complete its records are from each court. For example,
while CanLII has the entire corpus of Supreme Court decisions, it's only
maintained continuous coverage of the BC Court of Appeal (BCCA) since 1990. Other
courts have different starting dates for their continuous coverage.

This presents a systematic bias in our data, namely that more recent cases are
more readily available. To illustrate, the database contains 6,212 cases from the
BCCA before 1990, but 19,366 cases since. While we might be interested in
whether the volume of law is increasing over time, we must be careful to
restrict ourselves to the range of continuous coverage.

In case you're wondering --- no, it looks like the volume of law in BCCA has
been slowly decreasing since 1990:

<figure>
<div id="bcca-volume">
  select year, count(*) as count from decisions where court = 'bcca' and year >= 1990 and 2021 > year group by year;

  <script>
    lineChart(
      "#bcca-volume",
      "/home/sandy/prj/reasonablypolymorphic.com/site/data/1612394754.csv",
      "Year",
      d => +parseInt(d.year),
      "Number of Cases",
      d => +parseInt(d.count))
  </script>
</div>
<figcaption>number of cases in bcca since 1990</figcaption>
</figure>

Looking only at citation data introduces another systematic bias in the dataset:
older cases have had a longer time to accumulate citations. Because we mainly
keep track of relationships between cases, it's possible for recent cases to
contradict previous decisions. Such a case is clearly very important to the law,
but will fly under our radar until it becomes commonly cited.
