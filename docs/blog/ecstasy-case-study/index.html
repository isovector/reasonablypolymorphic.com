<div class="content">
    <p>In my (<a href="http://sandymaguire.me/blog/reaching-climbing/">copious</a>) spare time, I’ve been working on an <a href="https://github.com/isovector/typecraft">RTS game</a> written in Haskell. It’s using my entity-component system library <a href="https://github.com/isovector/ecstasy">ecstasy</a> in anger, for what is likely the library’s first time. As a result, I’m learning a lot about doing performance haggling with the compiler, as well as getting opportunities for <a href="/tags/haskell.html">even more</a> type-trickery. I thought both might make for interesting topics of discussion.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-ecstasys-internals">Overview of ecstasy’s internals</h2>
<p>Before diving into what I’ve been changing recently, it’s probably a good idea to quickly talk inside baseball about how ecstasy works. The basic idea is this, you define a “world” <a href="/blog/higher-kinded-data/">higher-kinded data</a> (HKD) corresponding to the components you care about. The library instantiates your HKD world in different ways to form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOS_and_SOA"><em>structure-of-arrays</em></a> corresponding to the high-efficiency storage of the ECS, and to form <em>just a structure</em> corresponding to an actual entity.</p>
<p>This machinery is built via the <code>Component</code> type family:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">type</span> <span class="kw">family</span> <span class="dt">Component</span> (<span class="ot">s ::</span> <span class="dt">StorageType</span>)</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>                      (<span class="ot">c ::</span> <span class="dt">ComponentType</span>)</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>                      (<span class="ot">a ::</span> <span class="op">*</span>)<span class="ot"> ::</span> <span class="op">*</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Using <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.8.4/docs/html/users_guide/promotion.html"><code>DataKinds</code></a>, <code>Component</code> is parameterized by three types. <code>s :: StorageType</code> describes how the library wants to use this component – possibly in the “structure-of-arrays” format consumed by the library, or as an entity structure, to be used by the application programmer. <code>s</code> is left polymorphic when defining the HKD.</p>
<p>The <code>c :: ComponentType</code> parameter is used to indicate the <em>semantics</em> of the field; some options include “each entity may or may not have this field” or “at most one entity may have this field.” The former might be used for something like <code>position</code>, while the latter could be <code>focusedOnByTheCamera</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, <code>a :: *</code> is the actual type you want the field to have.</p>
<p>Having data is a great first step, but it’s currently just an opaque blob to the library. This is where <a href="https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-11.0/base-4.10.1.0/GHC-Generics.html">GHC.Generics</a> comes in – given an (auto-derivable) <code>Generic</code> instance for our world, we can use <code>GHC.Generics</code> to automatically further derive more specialized machinery for ourselves.</p>
<p>As an example, assume our world looked like this (absent the <code>Component</code> trickery):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">World</span> f <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">World</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  {<span class="ot"> position ::</span> f (<span class="dt">V2</span> <span class="dt">Double</span>)</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  ,<span class="ot"> graphics ::</span> f <span class="dt">Graphics</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>we can use <code>GHC.Generics</code> to automatically generate the equivalent to a function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ot">getEntity ::</span> <span class="dt">Int</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">World</span> <span class="dt">Data.IntMap.IntMap</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">World</span> <span class="dt">Maybe</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>getEntity ent storage <span class="ot">=</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="dt">World</span> (Data.IntMap.lookup ent <span class="op">$</span> position storage)</span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        (Data.IntMap.lookup ent <span class="op">$</span> graphics storage)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>which converts from a structure-of-arrays representation to a structure-of-maybes. The actual technique behind implementing these generic functions is out of scope for today’s topic, but I’ve <a href="/blog/free-lenses/">written on it previously</a>.</p>
<p>For its part, <code>ecstasy</code> exposes the <code>SystemT</code> monad, which at its heart is just a glorified <code>Control.Monad.Trans.State.StateT (Int, World 'Storage)</code>. The <code>Int</code> keeps track of the next ID to give out for a newly created entity.</p>
<p>To a rough approximation, this is all of the interesting stuff inside of <code>ecstasy</code>. So armed with this knowledge, we’re ready to tackle some of the problems that have been unearthed recently.</p>
<h2 id="stupid-space-leaks">Stupid space leaks</h2>
<p>My original test for <code>ecstasy</code> was a <a href="https://github.com/isovector/iwmag">small platformer</a> – a genre not known for the sheer number of entities all interacting at once. As a result, <code>ecstasy</code> performed terribly, but I didn’t notice because I hadn’t benchmarked it or actually stress-tested it whatsoever. But that’s OK, I wrote it to scratch an itch while hanging out in a Thai airport; I’ve never claimed to write titanium-grade software :)</p>
<p>But in my RTS, the library was obvious struggling after allocating only 100 dudes. The thing was leaking memory like crazy, which was because I used lazy state and containers. Oopsie daisies! Replacing <code>Control.Monad.Trans.State</code> and <code>Data.IntMap</code> with their strict versions cleared it up.</p>
<p>Honestly I’m not sure why the lazy versions are the default, but I guess that’s the world we live in. <strong>SANDY’S HOT PRO TIPS</strong>: don’t use lazy maps or state unless you’ve really thought about it.</p>
<h2 id="virtual-components">Virtual components</h2>
<p>While working on my RTS, I realized that I was going to need fast spacial queries to answer questions like “is there anyone around that I should attack?” The result was <a href="/blog/free-lenses/">some sort of Frankenstein bastard child</a> of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree">quadtree</a> and a reverse index to answer both “where am I?” and “who’s nearby?”</p>
<p>This worked well to answer the queries I asked of it, but posed a problem; in order to maintain its indices, my datastructure needed to be the source of truth on who was where. Having a <code>position</code> component wasn’t going to cut it anymore, since the ECS was no longer responsible for this data. I briefly considered trying to write a shim to keep the two datasources in sync, but it felt simultaneously like an ad-hoc hack and a maintenance nightmare, so I gave up and removed the component.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all was not well. I added some monadic getters and setters to help shuffle the position information around, but oh god this became a garbage fire. Things that were before atomic updates now had extra calls to get and set the bastard, and everything was miserable.</p>
<p>I realized what I really wanted was the capability for <code>ecstasy</code> to be <em>aware</em> of components without necessarily being the <em>owner</em> of them. Which is to say, components whose reads and writes invisibly dispatched out to some other monadic system.</p>
<p>OK, great, I knew what I wanted. Unfortunately, the implementation was not so straightforward. The problem was the functions I wanted:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ot">vget ::</span> <span class="dt">Ent</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> m (<span class="dt">Maybe</span> a)</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ot">vset ::</span> <span class="dt">Ent</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Update</span> a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> m ()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>had this troublesome <code>m</code> parameter, and there was no clear place to put it. The monad to dispatch virtual calls to is a property of the interpretation of the data (actually running the sucker), not the data itself.</p>
<p>As a result, it wasn’t clear where to actually keep the <code>m</code> type parameter. For example, assuming we want <code>position</code> to be virtual in our world:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">World</span> s <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">World</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  {<span class="ot"> position ::</span> <span class="dt">Component</span> s <span class="dt">&#39;Virtual</span> (<span class="dt">V2</span> <span class="dt">Double</span>)</span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Somehow, after unifying <code>s ~ 'Storage</code>, we want this to come out as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">World</span> <span class="dt">&#39;Storage</span> <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">World</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  {<span class="ot"> position ::</span> ( <span class="dt">Ent</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> m (<span class="dt">Maybe</span> (<span class="dt">V2</span> <span class="dt">Double</span>)        <span class="co">-- vget</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>                , <span class="dt">Ent</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Update</span> (<span class="dt">V2</span> <span class="dt">Double</span>) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> m ()  <span class="co">-- vset</span></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>                )</span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But where do we get the <code>m</code> from? There’s no obvious place.</p>
<p>We could add it as a mandatory parameter on <code>World</code>, but that forces an implementation detail on people who don’t need any virtual fields.</p>
<p>We <em>could</em> existentialize it, and then <code>unsafeCoerce</code> it back, but… well, I stopped following that line of thought pretty quickly.</p>
<p>My first solution to this problem was to add a <code>Symbol</code> to the <code>Virtual</code> component-type token, indicating the “name” of this component, and then using a typeclass instance to actually connect the two:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">World</span> s <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">World</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  {<span class="ot"> position ::</span> <span class="dt">Component</span> s (<span class="dt">&#39;Virtual</span> <span class="st">&quot;position&quot;</span>) (<span class="dt">V2</span> <span class="dt">Double</span>)</span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  }</span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">-- we put the monad here: `m`</span></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><a href="#cb7-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">instance</span> <span class="dt">VirtualAccess</span> <span class="st">&quot;position&quot;</span> m (<span class="dt">V2</span> <span class="dt">Double</span>) <span class="kw">where</span></span>
<span id="cb7-7"><a href="#cb7-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  vget <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="op">...</span></span>
<span id="cb7-8"><a href="#cb7-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  vset <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="op">...</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>While it <em>worked</em>, this was obviously a hack and my <a href="/blog/follow-the-denotation/">inner muse of library design</a> was so offended that I spent another few days looking for a better solution. Thankfully, I came up with one.</p>
<p>The solution is one I had already skirted around, but failed to notice. This monad is a property only of the interpretation of the data, which is to say it really only matters when we’re building the world <em>storage</em>. Which means we can do some janky dependency-injection stuff and hide it inside of the storage-type token.</p>
<p>Which is to say, that given a world of the form:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">World</span> s <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">World</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  {<span class="ot"> position ::</span> <span class="dt">Component</span> s <span class="dt">&#39;Virtual</span> (<span class="dt">V2</span> <span class="dt">Double</span>)</span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>we could just pass in the appropriate monad when instantiating the world for its storage. Pseudocode:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">World</span> (<span class="dt">Storage</span> m) <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dt">World</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  {<span class="ot"> position ::</span> <span class="dt">Component</span> (<span class="dt">Storage</span> m) <span class="dt">&#39;Virtual</span> (<span class="dt">V2</span> <span class="dt">Double</span>)</span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>All of a sudden, the <code>Component</code> type family now has access to <code>m</code>, and so it can expand into the <code>vget</code>/<code>vset</code> pair in a type-safe way. And the best part is that this is completely invisible to the user who never needs to care about our clever implementation details.</p>
<p>Spectacular! I updated all of the code generated via <code>GHC.Generics</code> to run in <code>m</code> so it could take advantage of this virtual dispatch, and shipped a new version of <code>ecstasy</code>.</p>
<h2 id="polymorphic-performance-woes">Polymorphic performance woes</h2>
<p>While all of this virtual stuff worked, it didn’t work particularly quickly. I noticed some significant regressions in performance in my RTS upon upgrading to the new version. What was up? I dug in with the profiler and saw that my <code>GHC.Generics</code>-derived code was no longer being inlined. <a href="/blog/hkd-not-terrible/">HKD was performing more terribly than I thought!</a></p>
<p>All of my <code>INLINE</code> pragmas were still intact, so I wasn’t super sure what was going on. I canvassed #ghc on freenode, and the ever-helpful <a href="https://github.com/glguy">glguy</a> had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><glguy> generics can’t optimize away when that optimization relies on GHC applying Monad laws to do it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh. Lame. That’s why my performance had gone to shit!</p>
<p>I’m not sure if this is true, but my understanding is that the problem is that my monad was polymorphic, and thus the inliner wasn’t getting a chance to fire. glguy pointed me towards the aptly-named <a href="https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-11.9/lens-4.16.1/src/Control.Lens.Traversal.html#confusing">confusing</a> lens combinator, whose documentation reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fuse a <code>Traversal</code> by reassociating all of the <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> operations to the left and fusing all of the <code>fmap</code> calls into one. This is particularly useful when constructing a <code>Traversal</code> using operations from <code>GHC.Generics</code>…</p>
<p><code>confusing</code> exploits the <a href="https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-11.7/kan-extensions-5.1/Data-Functor-Yoneda.html">Yoneda</a> lemma to merge their separate uses of <code>fmap</code> into a single <code>fmap</code> and it further exploits an interesting property of the right Kan lift (or <a href="https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-11.7/kan-extensions-5.1/Data-Functor-Day-Curried.html">Curried</a>) to left associate all of the uses of <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> to make it possible to fuse together more <code>fmap</code>s.</p>
<p>This is particularly effective when the choice of functor <code>f</code> is unknown at compile time or when the <code>Traversal</code> in the above description is recursive or complex enough to prevent inlining.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds <em>exactly</em> like the problem I was having, doesn’t it? The actual <code>confusing</code> combinator itself was no help in this situation, so I dug in and looked at its implementation. It essentially lifts your <code>m</code>-specific actions into <code>Curried (Yoneda m) (Yoneda m)</code> (don’t ask me!), and then lowers it at the very end. My (shaky) understanding is this:</p>
<p><code>Yoneda f</code> is a functor even when <code>f</code> itself is not, which means we have a free functor instance, which itself means that <code>fmap</code> on <code>Yoneda f</code> can’t just lift <code>fmap</code> from <code>f</code>. This is cool if <code>fmap</code>ing over <code>f</code> is expensive – <code>Yoneda</code> just fuses all <code>fmap</code>s into a single one that gets performed when you lower yourself out of it. Essentially it’s an encoding that reduces an <span class="math inline">\(O(n)\)</span> cost of doing <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> <code>fmap</code>s down to <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span>.</p>
<p><code>Curried f f</code> similarly has a free <code>Applicative</code> instance, which, he says waving his hands furiously, is where the <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> improvements come from.</p>
<p>So I did a small amount of work to run all of my <code>GHC.Generics</code> code in <code>Curried (Yoneda m) (Yoneda m)</code> rather than in <code>m</code> directly, and looked at my perf graphs. While I was successful in optimizing away my <code>GHC.Generics</code> code, I was also successful in merely pushing all of the time and allocations out of it and into <code>Yoneda.fmap</code>. Curiously, this function isn’t marked as <code>INLINE</code> which I suspect is why the inliner is giving up (the isomorphic <code>Functor</code> instance for <code>Codensity</code> <em>is</em> marked as <code>INLINE</code>, so I am <em>very hesitantly</em> rallying the hubris to suggest this is a bug in an Ed Kmett library.)</p>
<p>Despite the fact that I’ve been saying “we want to run virtual monadic actions,” throughout this post, I’ve really meant “we want to run virtual applicative actions.” Which is why I thought I could get away with using <code>Curried (Yoneda m) (Yoneda m)</code> to solve my optimization problems for me.</p>
<p>So instead I turned to <a href="https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-11.7/kan-extensions-5.1/Control-Monad-Codensity.html#t:Codensity"><code>Codensity</code></a>, which legend tells can significantly improve the performance of free <em>monads</em> by way of the same mystical category-theoretical encodings. Lo and behold, moving all of my monadic actions into <code>Codensity m</code> was in fact enough to get the inliner running again, and as a result, getting our HKD once more to be less terrible.</p>
<p>If you’re curious in how <code>Codensity</code> and friends work their magic, glguy pointed me to a tutorial he wrote <a href="https://github.com/glguy/generic-traverse/blob/master/src/Boggle.hs">explaining the technique</a>. Go give it a read if you’re feeling plucky and adventurous.</p>
