The following is a progress report for [Certainty by
Construction][cbc], a new book I'm
writing on learning and effectively wielding Agda. Writing a book is a tedious
and demoralizing process, so if this is the sort of thing you're excited about,
please do let me know!

Thanks for all of your kind words of support after my last report. That's the
sort of thing that really helps keep me motivated. So thank you!

BUT GOOD NEWS. HERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT ALSO HELPS TO KEEP ME MOTIVATED.

I just wrapped up the last proof in the book!!!!

It's taken me all week to put together these glorious 50 lines of Agda, but it
makes for a damn fine finale for the book. So the game plan is now to delete
that last chapter I've got hanging around that's kinda about matrices, rewrite
the prose on isomorphisms, and then do one final polish pass where I add things
like indices and definitions.

Grad school has been much busier than I was expecting it to be, but no matter! I
will persevere. Being so close to the finish line is tantalizing and I expect
I'll just spend the next few days powering through it all. This thing is
definitely going to be finished by the end of the year.
