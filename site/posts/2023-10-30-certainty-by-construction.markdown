Happy days and happy news: it's done.

After a year of work, I'm *thrilled* to announce the completion my new book,
[Certainty by Construction][cbc].

[cbc]: https://leanpub.com/certainty-by-construction

Certainty by Construction is a book on doing mathematics and software design in
the proof assistant Agda, which is the language Haskell wants to be when it
grows up. The book is part Agda primer, introduction to abstract algebra, and
algorithm design manual, with a healthy dose of philosophy mixed in to help
build intuition.

If you're the sort of person who would like to learn more math (including all
the proof burden), and see how to apply it to writing real software, I think
you'd groove on this book. If it sounds up your alley, I'd highly encourage you
to [give it a read][cbc].

I'm not much on social media these days, but if you are, I'd really appreciate a
signal boost on this announcement! Thanks to everyone for their support and
understanding over the last year. I love you all!
